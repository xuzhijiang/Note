/**
 * 未翻译完成,请看102.Thread Safety in Java C Synchronization
 * <strong>Java synchronized</strong>
 * <p><br>
 * Synchronization is the tool using which we can achieve 
 * thread safety, JVM guarantees that synchronized code will 
 * be executed by only one thread at a time. java keyword 
 * synchronized is used to create synchronized code and 
 * internally it uses locks on Object or Class to make sure
 * only one thread is executing the synchronized code.
 * <p>
 * 同步是我们实现线程安全的工具,在内部它使用Object或Class上锁来确保只有一个线程正在执行同步代码。<br><p>
 * Java synchronization works on locking and unlocking of resource(Java的同步适用于锁定和解锁资源), 
 * before any thread enters into synchronized code, it has to acquire
 * lock on the Object and when code execution ends, it unlocks the resource
 * that can be locked by other threads. In the mean time other threads are 
 * in wait state to lock the synchronized resource.(同时，其他线程处于等待状态以锁定同步资源)
 * <p><br>
 * We can use synchronized keyword in two ways, one is to make a complete 
 * method synchronized and other way is to create synchronized block.
 * <p><br>
 * When a method is synchronized, it locks the Object, 
 * if method is static it locks the Class,
 * so it’s always best practice to use synchronized block (使用同步块是总是最佳实践)to 
 * lock the only sections of method that needs synchronization.(锁定需要同步方法的唯一部分)
 * <p><br>
 * While creating synchronized block, we need to provide the resource on which lock will be acquired,
 * it can be XYZ.class or any Object field of the class.
 * <p><br>
 * synchronized(this) will lock the Object before entering into the synchronized block.
 * <p>
 * You should use the lowest level of locking, for example
 * if there are multiple synchronized block in a class and one 
 * of them is locking the Object, then other synchronized blocks
 * will also be not available for execution by other threads. 
 * When we lock an Object, it acquires lock on all the fields of the Object.(当我们锁定一个Object时，它会获取Object的所有字段的锁定)
 * <p>
 * Java Synchronization provides data integrity on the cost of performance,(Java同步提供了性能成本方面的数据完整性)
 * so it should be used only when it’s absolutely necessary.
 * <p>
 * Java Synchronization works only in the same JVM, so if you need 
 * to lock some resource in multiple JVM environment, it will not work 
 * and you might have to look after some global locking mechanism(你可能需要照顾一些全局锁定机制).
 * Java Synchronization could result in deadlocks, check this post about deadlock in java and how to avoid them.
 * <p>
 * Java synchronized keyword cannot be used for constructors and variables.
 * <p>
 * It is preferable to create a dummy private Object to use for synchronized 
 * block(创建虚拟私有对象用于同步块是优选的), so that it’s reference can’t be changed by any other code.
 * For example if you have a setter method for Object on which you 
 * are synchronizing, it’s reference can be changed by some other 
 * code leads to parallel execution of the synchronized block.
 * <p>
 * We should not use any object that is maintained in a constant pool,(我们不应使用在常量池中维护的任何对象)
 * for example String should not be used for synchronization because 
 * if any other code is also locking on same String(因为如果其他的任何代码也锁定在相同的字符串上), it will try 
 * to acquire lock on the same reference object from String pool (它将会在字符池中获得相同引用对象的锁)
 * and even though both the codes are unrelated, they will lock each other.
